// 20. Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

let favrtCity:string[] = ["Okara","Sahiwal","Pakptan","Lahore","Muree "];

console.log(favrtCity[0]);
console.log(favrtCity[1]);
console.log(favrtCity[2]);
console.log(favrtCity[3]);
console.log(favrtCity[4]);
